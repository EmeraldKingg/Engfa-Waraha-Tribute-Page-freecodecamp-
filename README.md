# 🌸 Engfa Waraha Tribute Page  

> “Confidence with grace, that’s what Engfa taught me through her story.”  

This project is a **tribute page** I built for **Engfa Waraha**, a Thai musician, beauty queen, and someone whose journey reminds me that strength and softness can exist together.  

I created this as part of my [FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), but for me, it wasn’t just another coding task, it was an emotional and creative exercise in bringing admiration to life through code.

## 💫 Why Engfa  

Engfa’s story stood out to me, from her early roots in music to her rise as **Miss Grand Thailand 2022**, she represents resilience and artistry.  
I wanted my design to reflect her personality: elegant, confident, and timeless.  

I used a **dark theme** to create contrast, a bit like how Engfa shines even in quiet, understated moments.
